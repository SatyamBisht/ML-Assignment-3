Clustering
Assignment 3: K-Means Clustering
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm as part of Assignment 3. The goal is to cluster a given dataset into groups for k = 2 and k = 3, visualize the results, and analyze the clustering performance.

Dataset
The dataset can be found at the following link:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xHNXEdnyEcxMqlk4lA1JqVjKFr3sdV2Q/view?usp=drive_link

Requirements

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib

Implementation Details
Implemented K-Means from scratch (without using scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch).

Used NumPy for numerical computations.

Used Matplotlib for visualization.

Data normalization is applied before running K-Means.

The output and the code are present in the next jupyter nnotebook file.
